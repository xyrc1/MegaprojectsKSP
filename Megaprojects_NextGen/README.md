ABOUT MEGAPROJECTS
Megaprojects is a small series of mods consisting of (reused) ISRU (In-Situ Resource Utilization) parts and .cfg files designed for use with Extraplanetary Launchpads (EL), Tweakscale, and Rational Resources (RR). Megaprojects also seeks to make a more entertaining and in-depth late-game EL experience by adding new resources required to create and launch advanced parts. Kerbals will have to invent new ISRU parts such as large factories, processing facilities, and fusion reactors to create more advanced parts, beginning at nuclear technology. Explore distant stars to gather new materials for FTL technologies and more.
*note that Megaprojects does not provide any parts by itself, but intends to add compatibility to existing mods
