ABOUT MEGAPROJECTS
Megaprojects is a small series of mods consisting of (reused) ISRU (In-Situ Resource Utilization) parts and .cfg files designed for use with Extraplanetary Launchpads (EL), Tweakscale, and Rational Resources (RR). Megaprojects also seeks to make a more entertaining and in-depth late-game EL experience by adding new resources required to create and launch advanced parts. Kerbals will have to invent new ISRU parts such as large factories, processing facilities, and fusion reactors to create more advanced parts, beginning at nuclear technology. Explore distant stars to gather new materials for FTL technologies and more.
*note that Megaprojects does not provide any parts by itself, but intends to add compatibility to existing mods

ABOUT MEGAPROJECTS NEXTGEN
Megaprojects NextGen seeks to add more depth to the EL gameplay experience by adding new resources to build with and gather.

PROGRESSION
For starters, RocketParts can no longer be manufactured in EL parts as all EL parts have been stripped of their converters and parts dedicated to processing resources have been removed.

In MKS, EL constructions are made from MaterialKits and SpecializedParts (4:1), but have now been re-replaced with RocketParts.
RocketParts (RP) must be manufactured at a 4:1 (mass) ratio in various MKS parts. They are used in all non-configurated parts.
The next tier up from RocketParts are Advanced RocketParts (ARP). They are made with SpecializedParts and RareMetals in addition to previously made RP, in the same parts you would make RP in, also producing some ScrapMetal, which can now be reprocessed in some MKS parts.
They are used in science labs and advanced chemical rocket engines like the 'Vector' (SSME) or aerospikes.

After ARP comes NuclearGradeParts (NGP), which need to be made in more advanced machinery. These require Alloys and continue the recursive chain.
They are used in most nuclear parts, such as NERVAs and reactors. They make up 80% of gas core NTRs and are also used in lower tier electric/ion engines.
Extreme RocketParts are next (ERP), which require Robotics and Synthetics.
They are used in highly advanced nuclear technology such as NSWR engines, 20% of gas core NTRs, and more.
FusionParts (FuP) required Prototypes and huge amounts of Alloys, and require Atlas tier parts.
They are used in "lower" tier fusion parts, such as Daedalus engines, Z-pinch engines, Tokamaks and Stellarators.

Starting at Advanced FusionParts (AdvFuP), special resources are required.
Karmskadium (Ks), based on real-life superheavy element Darmstadtium, is a stable element that can be fused in a research fusion reactor from Xenon and RareMetals.
Adding these to FusionParts created Advanced FusionParts.
They are used in Bussard engines and more.

Antimatter Containers (AMC) are required to handle antimatter. The unique "material" Vulcanite (Vu) can be harvested from extremely hot bodies and is rich in lava and atmospheric conditions. It is neither matter nor antimatter, and can collide with both safely.
They are made from Prototypes, Vulcanite, and a small amount of Karmskadium. They do not require any previous tiers of resources.

The ultimate tier in MPNG is WarpCores. They require a third special resource, Tukanarium (Tk).
Tukanarium must be refined from Tukanarite in a research fusion reactor (likely to be changed in a future update) by processing it with Vulcanite, and also yielding Ks.
Pure Tukanarium exhibits the properties to bend space and time and generally defy reality and gravity in a near-handwavium sense.
Combining ACU, Tk, Ks, and large amounts of Prototypes, one can obtain the ultimate material for FTL and black-hole technology. WarpCores are also capable of stabilizing Graviolium.
